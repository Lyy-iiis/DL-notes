# Diffusion Models

Diffusion models: models data as generated by diffusion process

Problem Formulation: Given a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}$, where $x_i$ is a sample from the data distribution $p_{\text{data}}(x)$, we want to learn a $q(x)\approx p_{\text{data}}(x)$.

Usage: image generation, denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, etc.
